Resource Configurations
=======================

git clone this repo into a folder and run `create_symlinks.sh` to automatically wire up the `.rc` files to your bash profile.

For vim set up please see the [vim-config](https://github.com/dimroc/vim-config).

How to use
----------

The color scheme used for bash is [Solarized Dark Color Scheme](https://github.com/altercation/solarized).
Please follow the instructions there for Solarized. You can continue without Solarized.

1. Create soft links from your **home directory** to this repo's folder:

    ```
    ~$ ./workspace/dotfiles/create_symlinks.sh ~/workspace/dotfiles
    ```

    `./workspace/dotfiles` should be the folder of this repo

2. Copy `gituserconfig.template` to `gituserconfig` in the repo's folder and add your personal information.

    ```
    [user]
      name = Your Name
      email = your@email.com
    [github]
      user = Username
    ```

    Becomes

    ```
    [user]
      name = Dimitri Roche
      email = personal@email.com
    [github]
      user = dimroc
    ```
